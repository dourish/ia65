;;; IA65 is an interactive assembler for the 65C02 processor, with
;;; the goal of being self-hosted.
;;;
;;; The starting point is something that will assemble line-by-
;;; line, and then after that, something that can also read
;;; from an SD card as if it were terminal input.
;;;
;;; It is written for the Mite 6502 single-board computer.
