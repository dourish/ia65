Each line is a comment, a directive or an instruction.

Comments begin with ; and continue to end of line

Directives are signalled with a leading dot. Valid directives are
.ORG address  -- sets assembly pointer to address
.BYTE data    -- assembles a single byte of data
.WORD data    -- assembles a two-byte word in big-endian format
.EQU value    -- sets last defined label to value
.DUMP range   -- range is of form 3000-30FF or "3000 FF" (start/count)

An instruction is an optional label with an optional standard-format
6502 instruction. These are valid:

  LOOP1   CLC

  INSERT  LDA ($500),Y
  END     RTS

A string that begins with a valid opcode is not valid as a label.

Numbers are always hexadecimal. If a leading $ is given, it is
ignored. Labels may be used anywhere a number is given, e.g.
  SPACE .EQU 20
  LDA #SPACE
